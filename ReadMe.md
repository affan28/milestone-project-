================================================================================================================================================================
This project is related to the rock website development .In this website i have created about 8 html files and two css files and one read me file with it .
================================================================================================================================================================
So,basically the website is all about the rock band from 1960's .They have landing home or index.html page where all their info is mentioned ,then we have
fan.html,events.html,music.html,photos.html,about.html file with it.it has a contact page where you can contact the manager of the band for the music concerts 
and events.For viewing their live events listing or upcoming events listing the band has provided the events sections as well.Fans can post their love and 
testimonials on fan.html page .This band has also provided their gallery of photos for the fans to check out .
=================================================================================================================================================================
UX
The website is for the rock band .Who wans to promote their band and to gather the fan following .For that they have created their own website 
which includes the home page to tell about the band and in this website they are showing their events i.e where they are performing their concerts and travelling
.
=================================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================================
The website is for the people who love the rock band and wants to interact with the band to know them more .
=================================================================================================================================================================
=================================================================================================================================================================
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
Existing Features

Contact form:
The contact form is created to take input from the users as the project is for frontend so it would not implement any process in the band with any php line of 
code but it does process on the front end to message page whhere it shows one line of message that the message has been submitted.I haved added features that shows the errors and validation
for the users to see whether they have given any input or not .
